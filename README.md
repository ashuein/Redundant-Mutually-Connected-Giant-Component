 This program reads data (edgelist) for  a multiplex network with M=3 layers 
 in the format :
 layer node1 node2 weight (weight to be disregarded)
 
 It consider a single random configuration of initial damage  
 and evaluates the Redudant Mutually Connected Giant Component as a function of the fraction of  nodes damaged
 The Message Passing algorithm for each single realization of the random damage
 is calculated on the same network.
 
 INPUT
 N total number of nodes filename of the edgelist

 
 OUTPUT
 
 The output file "Redundant_MP.txt"  contains two columns: 
 p=1-f the fraction of non damaged nodes, and the size of the RMCGC predicted by the Message Passing Algorithm
 
 The output file "Redundant_sim.txt"  contains two columns: 
 p=1-f the fraction of non damaged nodes  and the size of the RMCGC obtained by direct numerical calculations
